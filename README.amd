# 🌙 Moonix Project

Moonix is a Discord server dedicated to providing easy access to free obfuscators ([Join here](https://discord.gg/Agdgwp8efW)) 🛠️. As the developer of the Moonix bot, **tedious**, I decided to take it a step further and create my own obfuscator project. 

## 🚧 Current Status

At this stage, what I have is more of an *uglifier* than a true obfuscator. It's a work in progress — still very rough (quite rough) and extremely easy to debug. 

## 🔧 Future Plans

The goal is to improve this project over time, making it more effective, secure, and complex. I'm committed to refining the code and adding more features to make it a solid tool for developers.

Feel free to follow along and provide feedback! 🚀
